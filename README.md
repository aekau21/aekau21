**`Data Science Undergraduate (DS Major at Chaminade University of Honolulu)`**

I am an undergraduate student studying Data Science at Chaminade University of Honolulu. I joined the Data Science major in January 2023 after spending two years as a pre-med student with a major in psychology and a goal of attaining a Doctor of Physical Therapy degree(DPT) at A.T. Still University. My transition into this new field has ignited a strong desire to learn and grow, and I am eager to seize any opportunities that come my way.

  <summary> 🖥️ Work Experience</summary>

Since becoming a Data Science undergraduate, I have had the opportunity to work on two projects/internships. The first involved collaborating with the Maunalua Fishpond Heritage Center to develop a dashboard for monitoring fishpond health. The second project was part of my participation in the SPICE 2023 Data Science program at Chaminade University of Honolulu. For this project, I conducted sentiment analysis using natural language processing (NLP) to analyze Climate Change Misinformation in Selective Media.
